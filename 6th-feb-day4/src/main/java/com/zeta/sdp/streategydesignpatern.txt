Strategy Design Pattern consist of 3 main components:

1. Strategy (interface)
2. Concrete implementation
3. Context (where we use the implemented methods)

in our example of BMS, the 3 Components are

i. Strategy
1. interface for BankingTask which defines abstract methods like Deposit, Withdraw, LoanIssue
2. This interface acts as the strategy which defines the behavior

ii. Concrete Implementation
1. Implement the BankingTask strategy
2. It also provides concrete implementation for methods like Deposit, Withdraw, LoanIssue
3. Each implementation represents different strategy

iii. Context
1. Create the BankAccount, LoanAccount class
2. These classes use the BankingTask interface's implementation
3. Then they use these methods and for business purposes
